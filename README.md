# FloatingFarmYaw
This is the code repository corresponding to the manuscript “Floating Offshore Wind Farm Yaw Control via Model-based Deep Reinforcement Learning”, submitted to IEEE Power & Energy Society General Meeting

## Brief Summary
   The basic motivation behind LoFT is to provide a tool to support the grid intergration research of floating offshore wind farms. To achieve this, we need to put computational efficiency in the first place since the grid intergration research requires simulating large amounts of FOWTs. As a result, LoFT  only reservs the degrees of freedom that notabley influence the power output of FOWTs.
